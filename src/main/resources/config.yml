# Follow this pattern when creating food effect configs
# FOODNAME:
#   effects:
#     - EFFECTNAME
#     - TIME (in seconds)
#     - AMPLIFIER (0 based)
#     - EFFECTNAME
#     - TIME (in seconds)
#     - AMPLIFIER (0 based)
#   morph:
#     - ANIMALNAME (or null for no morph)
#     - TIME (time until morph wears off, in seconds)
#
# Example
# cooked_beef:
#   effects:
#     - blindness
#     - 5
#     - 1
